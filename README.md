# Student Performance & Engagement Analysis in an Online Course 
<br><br>
## Part A :- Introduction of dataset.

   
This dataset showcases the activities and engagement patterns of students enrolled in various online courses in a single platform. It contains raw and inconsistent information about student activity.It is cleaned and analyzed using Microsoft Excel for data preparation and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard that highlights learner progress, attendance, and feedback.

### The Approach ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ§:-

**BI) Dealing with inconsistencies** :-  
1) Converted 'Time_Spent' values into hours (handle "30 mins", "1.5", etc) using find and replace method.
2) Split each session attended by students from the Session_Attendance column using Text to Columns with a **comma (,)** as the delimiter.
3) Filtered out invalid email entries since email is the main identification for online students 

**BII) Dealing with null**             
1) Fixed invalid/missing 'Age' entries using mean/median imputation.

   <pre>               =IF(OR([@Age]=0,ISBLANK([@Age])),ROUND(AVERAGE(FILTER(F2:F1144,F2:F1144<>0)),0),[@Age]) 
   </pre>

**BIII) Dealing with duplicates**      
    Identified duplicates and removed it using remove duplicates

**BIV)	Create new columns:**	         
*1)*  Created **Performance column** and added a flag for "High Performer": Completed == Yes and Rating â‰¥ 4.

<pre>                  =IF(AND([@Completed]="Yes",[@[Feedback_Rating]]>3),"High Performer",
                   IF(AND([@Completed]="Yes",[@[Feedback_Rating]]<=3),"Low Performer","Not Completed"))         
</pre>
      
*2)*  Created new column **Experience_Level** (based on age: Student, Early Career, etc.)
                                        
   <pre>                  =IF(AND([@Age]>=18,[@Age]<=22),"Student", 
                   IF(AND([@Age]>=23,[@Age]<=30),"Early Career", 
                   IF(AND([@Age]>=31,[@Age]<=40),"Mid Career",  
                   IF(OR([@Age]=0,ISBLANK([@Age]),[@Age]<18),"Unknown","Senior"))))   </pre>

*3)*  Created new column based on **Engagement Level** (based on Time Spent + Progress) 

    <pre>   (Decimal progress X 10) + Time Spent(Hours)  </pre>

## Part C: Power BI :â€“ Advanced Dashboard creation using PBI

 **Glimse:- ðŸ”´ðŸ”´**

### The Approach ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ§:-

**CI) Tools used for dashboard** :-

1) Created dashboards for Overview Page (KPIs, summary),Category Analysis,Engagement Heatmaps
2) KPI Cards for Total Students, Avg. Progress, Avg. Rating, Course Completion Rate
3) Bar/Column Charts for Students by Course Category, Completion rate by Country
4) Used Matrix and Tables to analyse the Feedback Ratings of each course and get awareness of completion rate and average time spent per course
                                        Pic
5) Line/Area Chart for Enrollment trend by month Custom Measures (DAX) for Completion % by Category,Avg. Time Spent per Category,Correlation between Progress and Rating (scatter plot)
6) Drill-through to student details from summary cards.
7) Use slicers: Course Category, Country, Experience Level
8) Scatter plot visual showing correlation between feedback rating and progress (%), grouped by performance level.

**CII) New Column using DAX:-**
   
Using DAX formula, we create a summary table by course category, showing how students perform and engage in each course. It calculates enrollments, completions, completion rate, total and average time spent, and each courseâ€™s share of total study time, helping to evaluate overall learning performance and effort distribution.

CIII)**Interactive Dashboards**


1. **Course and Completion :-** Displays total student enrollments by course and year.
Shows completion details per country â€” quickly identifying regions with the highest completion rates.
Includes slicers to filter by course category (Business, Data Science, Design, etc.).
Key insight: India has the highest student participation, while the overall completion rate varies across courses.

**2. Summary and Feedback**

Summarizes feedback ratings per course in a detailed matrix view.
Displays overall course completion rate (46.99%) against a goal of 100%.
Includes a completion rate vs. average time spent comparison for each course category.
Key insight: Data Science and Design courses show strong engagement but moderate completion.

ðŸ”µ 3. Rating vs. Progress and KPI Cards

Insight: High performers maintain progress above 70% with ratings â‰¥4; low performers cluster around lower progress percentages.
